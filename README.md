**Overview**

This repository contains R scripts dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is a critical step in data analysis, allowing us to understand the structure and characteristics of the data before applying more advanced techniques or modeling. The scripts in this repository focus on distribution visualization and statistical modeling in R, providing a solid foundation for analyzing datasets.

**Files Included:**

- EDA Distribution Visualization in R: This script focuses on visualizing the distribution of data using different charts, such as histograms, boxplots, and density plots, to help understand the distribution and variability of the dataset.
- EDA Statistical Modeling in R: This script focuses on performing basic statistical modeling techniques, such as correlation analysis and regression, to explore relationships between variables and gain deeper insights from the data.

**Key Features**

1. EDA Distribution Visualization in R

    This script provides methods to visualize the distribution of data:

    - Histograms: To show the frequency distribution of a variable.
    - Boxplots: To visualize the spread and identify outliers in the data.
    - Density Plots: To estimate the probability density function of a continuous variable.

    These visualizations help identify the underlying distribution patterns, outliers, and skewness in the dataset.

2. EDA Statistical Modeling in R

    This script covers some basic statistical modeling techniques in R:

    - Correlation Analysis: Helps assess the relationship between two or more variables.
    - Simple Linear Regression: Fits a linear model to the data to understand the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable.
    - Multiple Linear Regression: Extends the simple linear regression model to include multiple independent variables.

    These statistical models are useful for exploring relationships and potential predictors in the data.
